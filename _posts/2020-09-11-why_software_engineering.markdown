   	 I decidied to study Software Engineering because first, I wanted a rewarding and exciting career. Second I have somehow always gotten drawn back into anything revolving tech. I was in robotics for two years in high school and I loved it. When I went to college I got scared/ discouraged to pursue any type of engineering or computer science majors. I felt like I didn't have what it took to be in the major and finish school. In my head I thought those majors were for super smart people who know all about calculas or organic chemistry. I recently had a whole personality change and changed the way I think mentally. I recently learned that I have to make a change and push/ better myself if I want to get anywhere in this world. I saw an add about Flatiron School in my social media and I was sold because it seemed like a sign. I'm a very spontaneous person so I started completing the bootcamp and applied. In my head I thought "what is the worst that can happen?" Now I'm here and more eager to learn and graduate.
